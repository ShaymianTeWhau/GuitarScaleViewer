# GuitarScaleViewer

This app is scale reference tool for guitar and bass.

A scale in music is a specific set of notes arranged in order of pitch (for example, low to high).
Each scale has a particular pattern of intervals - the distances between notes - which gives it a distinct sound or mood (such as “happy” or “sad”).

On a guitar fretboard, these notes appear at specific fret positions across the strings.
The GuitarScaleViewer visualises these positions across the instrument.
